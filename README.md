## Github and how it works  

### Git

Git is a piece of software that keeps track of the entire history of things that you do on your computer, and it also contains several advanced features for collaboration on the same document. Esentially, Git is just a version control software.

### Github

Github is a web service where you sign up, have an account, and be able to use Git through a clean user interface. It is a platform where developers can share and manage their code.

### Repo

Repo is short for repository. A repository in Github is essentially a project that can have multiple files in it, it is a place where you can have files. You can name your repository, but the name is not allowed to have any spaces, and spaces are represented by dashes.

### Commit

When you are working on a file, you want to save your changes so you don't have to do it all over again. Commiting is how you do this, you are saving what progress you made as a version history, which connects to the function of Git.
